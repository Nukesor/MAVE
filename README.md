# the Most Adorable Violence Ever

MAVE is a game of fun and, especially, violence. In a world full of very cute cuties, you are the villain. Your despicable goal is to kill them all - and the more you kill, the cuter it gets.

MAVE is written in [Löve](https://www.love2d.org/), a game library for lua.

To get it running on your system, Install löve, clone the repo and execute `make` in the new directory.
