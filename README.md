# the Most Adorable Violence Ever

MAVE is a game of fun and cuteness. Prove yourself in a world full of small furballs called cuties. Battle against a range of different enemies, get new weapons, new skills and new levels. And the further you are, the cuter it gets!

MAVE is written in [Löve](https://www.love2d.org/), a game library for lua.

To get it running on your system, Install löve, clone the repo and execute `make` in the new directory.
